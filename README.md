# Image_Classifier

This project is a flower classifier built using PyTorch. It utilizes pretrained models such as VGG16 or Resnet or Inception_v3 or ImageNet etc. to extract features from images and then uses a feedforward neural network to classify the images into different flower species. The project includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the entire process of building and training the model, as well as a train.py script that allows user to select the pretrained models and a predict.py script for making predictions using the trained model. The model is trained on a dataset of flower images and is able to accurately classify new images into different flower species. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in image classification and provides a functional tool for classifying flower images.

You can train your own model using train.py or use predict.py using a trained model.
